I worked on this game for several months and since the beginning my vision of this game changed multiple times. I often had to reject ideas or change my way of approach. The overall role model for this game was the classic 'Moorhuhn's Hank'1, which I loved playing in my childhood. Although the size of this project exceeded by far everything I had achieved before, I decided to give it a try. My goal was to come as close to original game as possible, maybe even surpass it in a few areas. I am now going to show you the result of this undertaking.",

Every teams needed to work on two given tasks for several months and go through the different stages of project development. In this processing period we learned many things about teamwork, different ways to organize an IT project and, of course, new aspects of the already mentioned programming languages. In this section I want to give you an idea of our tasks and how we solved them.",
